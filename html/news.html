                        get. We will put out more information when it starts to get closer to 
                        beta-time in November. Hopefully you guys will look forward to this as much
                        as we do.

                        We have been incredibly lucky and gotten the chance to have our own booth
                        at Gamescon 2015 in Germany. This is a major milestone for our small studio
                        and we hope that we can meet some of you guys there. We will have some 
                        computers hooked up so that it will be possible to test our game in the 
                        state that it is at the time. All of us at G303 Studios are really looking 
                        forward to the event and will work even harder to get a good feel on the 
                        game while we are there. 
                        See you guys in Germany 5-9 of August!
