                <p>
                    Play as a General Utility And Repair Drone, a Guard, in this fast pace, team based, 
                    tug of war. Where team work is essential to get your pilot and yourself of the hostile
                    planet that you crashlanded on. Collect energy cells to power up the ships engine while
                    protecting both the pilot and the ship from hordes of hostile aliens. The twist is 
                    that their is another team of Guard's that also want to escape the planet. 
                    Good luck, and may the best team survive!

                <h3 class="h3Headline">Collect the energy cells or die trying</h3>
                <p>
                    The energy cells gives the game an exciting and competative element. The planet holds
                    only one cell at the time, until that one is collected an stored in one of the ships
                    it is an all out tug of war for that specific cell. 
                    Hope your up to the fast paced challange!
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="h3Headline">Upgrade, to get the upperhand</h3>
                <p>
                    You can earn experience when killing any of the hostile enemies. This experience will
                    generate level up for your Guard, the level up system is executed in-game and it is 
                    only one click away. When there is a new level, you as a player click on the button
                    that is marked with the thing that you want to get better at, simple as that. You can
                    improve in four different fields, range weapon, melee weapon, speed and thoughness.
                    Even the ship can reach new levels. When your team has collected an energy cell and
                    are about to place it in the ship you will get to choose where to place it, offense
                    or defense. Depending on which you choose the ship will get a boost in that field.
                    Choose wisely!
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="h3Headline">Planetary madness</h3>
                <p>
                    The first planet that is playable is an alien forest world, here you will encounter
                    glades, lakes and even some smaller swamps. Do not forget that there are more planets
                    under development, amongst them are an alien mountain world with snowy cliffs, ravines 
                    and since long forgotten alien technology and one planet with a large fallen city
                    environment, where you can count on fire and smoke along side ruined buildings and
                    destroyed alien vehicles.
                    Which one will be your favorite?
